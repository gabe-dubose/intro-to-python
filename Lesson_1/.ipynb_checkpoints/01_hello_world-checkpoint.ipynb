    "Now that we have covered the basics of print statemtns, variable assignment, and string manipulations, we will go over a worked exmaple, and then into some practive problems. This example will be an early introduction to one of the most important aspects of programming: developing an approach before writing code. This might seem a bit silly because this is not a very complicated example. It would be easy enough to just write the code very quickly. However, it is good to start practicing this because it will make more complex tasks more approachable. That being said, let's get into the example."
