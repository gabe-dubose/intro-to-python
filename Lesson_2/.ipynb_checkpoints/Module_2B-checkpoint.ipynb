    "The big picture of this course is to introduce you to Python through the lens of webscraping. To reiterate what was mentioned in the <i>Introduction</i> module, when we scrape a webpage, we are really just searching through each line in the HTML file and searching for key tags and terms that identify different elements. Before we get started, lets recall a few key topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, most webpages are just HTML files that have additional style added to them (which can be done a variety of ways). Each line of this file can be treated as plain text and saved as a string, which we can then manipulate like we would any string (covered in Module 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, since we can make each line in an HTML file into a string, we can save these lines into a list. This will become very important when we talk about how to loop through each item in a list to scrape it. For now, we are just going to cover how to construct said list."

    "Since we are dealing with files that are now going to be saved onto our computer, we need to go over how to tell Python where to find these files. In order to do this, we need to go over what exactly files and directories are.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Directories</b>, simply put, are locations for storing files on a computer. This is easy to illustrate by looking at the folders on your desktop (directories and folders are the same thing). As an exercise, say we have a folder called \"Projects\" on our Desktop. Within this folder, there are 5 folders: Baby_Kicks, Concrete_Jungle, GreenLight_Fund, The_Bakery, and The_Carter_Center. Directories are set up in a herirachical system. Therefore, the <b>path</b> to the \"Baby_Kicks\" folder is <b><i>/Desktop/Projects/Baby_Kicks</i></b>. A path is just the directions to your directory or file, where each location is separated by a \"/\". In the path to the Baby_Kicks directory, the first location is the \"Desktop.\" After \"Desktop\" comes \"Projects.\" This means that the Projects directory is inside of the Desktop directory. Likewise, the Baby_Kicks folder is inside of the Projects directory. You can think of this as a sort of tree-like structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "                       |\n",
    "                    Desktop\n",
    "                       |\n",
    "               |---------------|\n",
    "          Other_folders     Projects\n",
    "                               |\n",
    "               |---------------|------------------|-----------|----------------| \n",
    "           Baby_Kicks  Concrete_Jungle  GreenLight_Fund    The_Bakery     The_Carter_Center\n",
    "                         \n",
    "                         \n",
    "You may have noticed that in our example file path, there was a \"/\" infront of the \"Desktop\" directory as well. This implies that there is some directory that the \"Desktop\" directory is inside of. Your entire computer is set up in this, and your Desktop is just your main interface. There are many other directories further up the tree (towards the root), but we don't have to worry about these right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Files</b> are objects that simply hold various kinds of data. The path to a file is just the path to the directory is it inside of, with it's name tagged onto the end. For example, say there is a file inside of the Baby_Kicks directory called \"Results.txt.\" The path to this file would be <b><i>/Desktop/Projects/Baby_Kicks/Results.txt</i></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more depth that we can go into on this topic. However, this is a Python course, not a general computer course. The simplest approach for your purposes as a beginner will be to work from your Desktop. That way you can physically see all of the directories and files that you will be dealing with."
