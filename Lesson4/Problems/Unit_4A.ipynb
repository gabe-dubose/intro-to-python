You will find yourself writing the same or similar code for similar tasks. To make life easier, we can put our code in <b>functions</b>, which are blocks of code that take input and perform the tasks that you put inside of the function. For example, you can write a function that will take a table and perform certain cleaning tasks. Once the function is written, you won't need to rewrite the code again. All you have to do is call the function with different inputs.\n","\n","We have used functions before. Python has built-in functions that we have been using since Unit 1. Things like <i>print()</i>, <i>split()</i>, <i>strip()</i>, <i>len()</i>, and <i>range()</i> are all example of functions that we have used in previous modules. Just like Python offers built in functions, we can make our own as well.\n","    \n","From using the native Python functions, you might have realized a few key things. First, some functions directly alter their target in-place, and others will return some value. We won't go too deep into the former. I would just like to introduce the term <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> (OOP for short), and you can look more into this topic when you feel comfortable with Python.
