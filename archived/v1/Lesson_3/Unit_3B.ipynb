    "One of the key functionalities offered by modern computers is quick iteration, often referred to as looping. <b>Loops</b> allow you to define a set of instructions and have a computer perform said instructions until some condition is met. Loops can be applied to anything that is <b>iterable</b>. The definition of an iterable is a little redundant: basically, anything that can be looped over. For example, you can loop through each letter in a string or each item in a list. This module is perhaps one of the most important because it will allow you to automate many of the tasks that we have covered so far.  "
