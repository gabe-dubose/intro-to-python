# An Introduction to Python
## Introduction

This course aims to provide an intruduction to the fundamentals of Python through the lense of data cleaning and manipulation. We will start by exploring basic Python data structures that can be used for manipulating data. We then look at how to automate data handling tasks using logic and loops. Once these foundational topics have been covered, we move into how to use Python in a more applied way to handle real data. 

Note: Currently, the course is organized into four lessons that each have two units. However, we are working on adding two additional lessons. This course is actively in development.
