# An Introduction to Python
## Introduction

This course aims to provide an intruduction to the fundamentals of Python through the lense of data cleaning and manipulation. We will start by exploring basic Python data structures that can be used for manipulating data. We then look at how to automate data handling tasks using logic and loops. Once these foundational topics have been covered, we move into how to use Python in a more applied way to handle real data. 

Note: Currently, the course is organized into four lessons that each have two units. However, we are working on adding two additional lessons. This course is actively in development. The previous iteration of this course can be found in the <i>archived</i> directory. 

## Course structure
The primary content of this course is contained in the folders designed <i>Lesson[1-4]</i>. Within each of these directories, there are two other folders that contain the notebooks and practice problems corresponding to said lesson. 

#### Notebooks
Each lesson has two notebooks that correspond to the two units. These notebooks contain the unit's contents in written form, as well as built-in code and text blocks for active note taking. 

#### Practice
Each lesson also has two sets of practice problems that correspond to the two units. These practice problems are meant to reinforce the contents covered in the corresponding unit. In later lessons, practice problems shift from more directed coding to more broad text descriptions of certain objectives.
