# An Introduction To Python Through Web Scraping

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that are one of the primary teaching tools for a course that is designed to introduce Python through the lens of web scraping. Videos associated with each lesson and unit are in development, and a more comprehensive interface for this course will be put together when these are complete.

This course is divided into four lessons, each with two primary units. Each unit is also broken down into different sections. The objective of this course is not to teach a comprehensive "How to Program with Python." Rather, this course aims to teach users the basics of Python so that they might be able to use to make tasks easier in their every day work.

NOTE: This course is still under development and more thorough documentation will be uploaded as it is completed.
